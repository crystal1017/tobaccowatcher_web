                        The global tobacco control environment changes every day. In this fast paced environment,
                        Tobacco Watcher helps you to stay on top of these changes by finding, analyzing and delivering
                        the worldâ€™s tobacco-related news right to you and in real-time. With these tools, you can
                        inspect and understand current and historic trends in tobacco-related media from all over the
                        world.
                    </p>

                    <p class="lead">
                        Find out the what, where and when by reading news articles selected by scanning millions of
                        articles from tens of thousands of unique sources in twenty-three languages.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Operating 24/7/365, this advanced data processing platform consists of two phases.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        First, our computers search the web to identify a vast range of potentially tobacco-related news
                        media with the help of both popular search engines and social media platforms. Constantly
                        scanning these sources, our computers examine millions of articles to find those that are
                        tobacco-related, identifying relevant articles with over ninety-nine percent accuracy using
                        sophisticated language understanding algorithms that go beyond keywords and phrases to identify
                        the core topic of each article.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Second, our computers sift through discovered tobacco-related news articles and organize them
                        for the tobacco control expert. Each article is analyzed to determine the center geographic
                        focus, and major subject category. All articles are automatically translated into English,
                        providing a portal to a global media landscape for the English-speaking user, while retaining
                        the original text for non-English speakers. For example, Tobacco Watcher currently classifies
                        news articles into eight subject categories (such as tobacco prices, including taxation or
                        minimum price laws) covering news describing the tobacco control landscape in eighty-two
                        nations.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        With both phases working in tandem, Tobacco Watcher finds over 3,000 news articles each day,
                        analyzing and delivering those most relevant to tobacco control advocates, policy makers, and
                        investigators.

                        You can filter through our archives using our custom designed classifications, such as filtering
                        to only view articles that are popular on social media, or personalize your filters by searching
                        for articles using keywords or phrases, including articles not written in but translated into
                        English.

                        Tobacco control advocates, investigators, and students spend can spend hours searching through
                        the same news articles to find tobacco-related content they care about. Tobacco Watcher now does
                        the searching for you. Moreover, by classifying tobacco-related media by content and location,
                        in twenty-three languages, you can explore far more of the tobacco control landscape than was
                        previously possible. As a result, advocates, policy makers and researchers can spend much more
                        of their time analyzing instead of searching for data.

                        knowledge generation, synthesis and translation, (2) evaluation and surveillance, and (3)
